# Face-Identification-and-Recognition
The ability of Machine System to recognize an person's face in an image. We will teach the machine how to detect and recognize a face.

We will be using the Open-Source Tool for this purpose, one of them is very famous and extensively used is 'Dlib' that has 'face_recognition' package that gives us access to pre-created models for face-recognition purposes and related use-case projects.

Feature Based Detection: **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** Feature based: This counts the occurences ofgradient orientation in an image.

The ipynb file in this repository has been created and worked upon in Google Colaboratory and so, some commands and pieces of code may be different and may not be required while working on local machine.
